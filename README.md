# oss-data-pipeline-stack
Attempt at making a cohesive open-source, self-hosted data pipeline.


## What is this?

This is an attempt at making a cohesive open-source, self-hosted data pipeline. It is a collection of tools that can be used to build a data pipeline that is open-source, self-hosted, and can be deployed on a single machine. It is not meant to be a production-ready solution, but rather a proof of concept that can be used to build a production-ready solution.
